To create the sio data file needed for this processing
need to download the data file J1312315.vla.21els.sio (346 MB)
from the website http://www.mpl.ucsd.edu/swellex96/s5.htm\

The matlab script sioread.m can be used to read the data file.
The matlab script compute_csdm.m is used to FFT and process the data file.
