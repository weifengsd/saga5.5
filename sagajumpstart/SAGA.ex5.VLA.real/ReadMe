   This is a simple example of how to run SAGA with a vertical array on
a multiple frequencies ( 49 Hz - 388 Hz )  The script runSAGA.scr will first 
obtain the input data in a form that SAGA likes.  See the ReadMe in the 
subdirectory 'fftData' for details on this process.  This section is currently 
commented out to increase the speed of the example.  Also the data file needs 
to be copied from the mpl website before this section is run.  Read the file 
'getData.txt' in the subdirectory 'fftData' for details of how to do this.

   The script runcsdm.scr first converts the CSDM data file in fftData
to a SAGA formatted data file. This is done in Matlab with a SAGA provided
M-file.  This M-file expects to have a single input file for each frequency
being processed. This M-file produces an output file called 'cov.in'
This is the input data file for SAGA.  

   Now that the data is set as the input file, run SAGA to produce the 
inversion data using the input parameter file 'vert.dat'.  The 
post-processor POST is run to compute the 'a posteriori' distribution. 
POST also appends a text copy of the results to the file 'results'.
   The script runs SAGA a second time using the input parameter file
'vertC.dat' to produce a contour plot of source range verses array tilt.
The third run of SAGA produces the source range verses source depth using
the parameter file vertC2.dat.  The ambiguity surfaces plotted are generated
with MFP processing using only the first two parameters in the input file.
Any additional search parmeters are not search, but default to their inital
value.  For the optimal MFP search results it is important to have the 
initial values in the search parameter files for the contour plots be
set to best fit results from the 'a posteriori' distribution.
   Matlab is run to generate the three postscript plots.  Using the provided
M-files in the SAGA matlab directory generate the inversion plot and the
contour plots. 

   The inversion plot shows a panel for each parameter searched. The plot
shows that source range and depth are well determined. The tilt panel shows
a less peaked but reasonably well defined result for the tilt.  The peak
for the tilt is at -1.429 m.  This peak does show clearly on the contour
plot.  The second contour plot shows the source depth verses range.  It has
a defined peak at a slightly longer range between 60 and 70 meters depth.  The
value that SAGA chose is 64.286 m deep for the source depth.  This depth
is a bit deeper than expected 

   The contour plot always shows the first two optimization parameters 
plotted with the first search parameter as the X-axis and the second 
search parameter as the Y-axis.  For optimal MFP results remaining
parameters should have their inital values set to the results of the
'a posteriori' best fit.

   The results file looks like:

The tilt of -1.429 meters is equivalent to  -0.682 degrees

      theta = arcsin(array_tilt/array_length)
            = arcsin( -1.429 m / 120 m )
            = arcsin( -0.01191 )
            = -0.682 degrees

This matches well to the expected tilt of between 0.5 and 1.0 degrees
for this time period. It is important to keep in mind that tilt in
SAGA is the horizontal deviation at the last reciever measured in meters.

For this data set the source range is 3 km and the source depth is 60 m.
The source range and depth are longer and deeper than expected.  This
is due to the mirage effect caused by different bathymetries. In this
case the source is in 200m of water and the array is in 216.5 meters
of water.  A difference of ~7.7 %  thus the values need to be reduced
by this amount giving a range of 3142.857 / 1.077 = 2918.2 m and
for the source depth of 64.286 / 1.077 = 59.690 m.  

In example 2 ( single frequency ) after correcting for the mirage effect
the range was very close but the depth was off by almost 10 meters. With
13 frequencies the depth matches and the range is still within one range
cell.

To learn more about the mirage effect see the section on the mirage
effect in the covert calibration example notebook. Also the paper
