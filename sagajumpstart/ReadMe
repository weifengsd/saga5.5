This directory contains 7 examples of running SAGA.  The first five
examples show how to run SAGA using a Vertical Line Array (VLA). 
The first two VLA examples are single frequency examples for a simple 
and fast introduction to running SAGA.  The next three VLA examples
demonstrate MFP using 13 frequencies.

The last two examples use SAGA to demonstrate MFP with a Horizontal 
Line Array(HLA) 


Vertical Line Arrays:

  single frequency examples: 
  SAGA.ex1.VLA.sim -   invert for tilt and range using 388 Hz (simulation)
  SAGA.ex2.VLA     -   invert for tilt and range using 388 Hz (real data) 
                       ( data from SWellEx96 Event S5 )

  multifrequency examples:
  SAGA.ex3.VLA.sim    - invert for source range, depth and tilt (MFP) (simulation)
  SAGA.ex4.VLA.kraken - invert for source range, depth and tilt (MFP) (simulation)
                        ( data generated by Kraken, field, and krakp )
                        ( data is imported to SAGA for processing    )
  SAGA.ex5.VLA.real   - invert for source range, depth and tilt (MFP) (real data)
                         ( data from SWellEx96 Event S5 )

Horizontal Line Arrays:
   SAGA.ex6.HLA.sim   - invert for source range, source depth, array azimuth, and
                        array bow  using multiple frequencies (simulation)

   SAGA.ex7.HLA.real  - invert for source range, source depth, array azimuth, and
                        array bow using multiple frequencies (real data)
                        ( data from SWellEx96 Event S5 )
