The SIO data file used is 'J1312340.hla.north.sio'.  In this case  data
starting at J131 23:46:00 were processed and FFTed with 11 bins extracted 
(frequency of interest plus 5 on either side in case
of doppler shift ) for each frequency of interest.

The out.freq.gs plots show if a consistent signal is received. The expected
plot would show that a single bin or 2 adjacent bins(if signal split
between two bins) contains most of the signal energy.  The main
purpose is to track a frequency through doppler shifts
and turns where the frequency of interest will shift a few bins.  

The file ffttime.'frequency' contains the maximum value at each time 
slice for each array element for the given frequency. The file
is complex. The number of channels in the file is the number of array
elements times 2 (complex data).  The number of samples in the file
is the number of FFT's ( with 50% overlap ) that are able to be 
performed on the original data file.
