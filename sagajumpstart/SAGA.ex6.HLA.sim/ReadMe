    This is an example of how to do Match Field Processing using multiple
frequencies with a Horizontal Line Array (simulated).  This simulation matches
the SWellEx96 Event S5 data set at J131 23:46.  The source is at a range
of 2080 km and depth of 60m.  The HLA was deployed with a line of bearing of 
34.5 degrees with a bow of -15 meters.  The four parameters, source range, 
source depth, array bearing, and array bow will be searched for in this example.
   Line of Bearing is calculated from Element #1 to the last element. For the 
HLA array Element #1 is the southernmost element.  
   There are a number of ways to input an array shape into SAGA, this example
uses the 'x' option. So the interelement spacing is defined in the input 
parameter file.  The array will be approximated by a parabola with the specified
interelement spacing so that bow values can be searched.  

   The script runSAGA.scr will first run SAGA to generate the simulated data
file. Then copy the input file from a *.obs extension to a *.in extension.
This is done for each input parameter file.
   Now that the data is set as the input file, run SAGA to produce the 
inversion data using the input parameter file 'horiz.dat'.  The post-processor 
POST is run to compute the 'a posteriori' distribution.  POST also appends a
text copy of the results to the file 'results'.
      The script runs SAGA a second set of times using the input parameter file
'horizC.dat' to produce a contour plot of source range verses array tilt.  The 
third set of runs of SAGA produces the source range verses source depth using
the parameter file horizC2.dat.  The ambiguity surfaces plotted are generated
with MFP processing using only the first two parameters in the input file.
Any additional search parmeters are not searched, but default to their inital
value.  SAGA outputs an input parameter file with these best fit values set
for the initial values.  This script demonstrats how to use this file to
always produce ambiguity surfaces using the best fit solution results.
   Matlab is run to generate the three postscript plots.  Using the provided
M-files in the SAGA matlab directory generate the inversion plot and the
contour plots. 
      The inversion plot shows a panel for each of the four parameters searched.
The plot shows that source range and source depth well determined.  The array 
azimuth and array bow both have a bimodal distribution.  There is not enough 
information to solve for the left-right ambiguity.  

   The results file looks like:

    The best fit result from SAGA does pick close to the correct azimuth and
bow for the array, expecting 39.5 degrees with a -15 m bow. SAGA picked an
azimuth of 320.3 degrees with a -15.0.   SAGA picked the negative symetry
solution over the desired solution.
   The contour plots always shows the first two optimization parameters 
plotted with the first search parameter as the X-axis and the second 
search parameter as the Y-axis.  
   The first plot shows the source range verses source depth. Normally for
a HLA to have the same accuracy as a VLA you need to have the HLA be 4x 
longer then the VLA.  The VLA from the previous examples is 120m long, so
the HLA would need to be 480 m long to have the same quality of results.
The HLA deployed was only 240 meters long. This difference is represented
in the ambiguity surface in a larger target location and a peak level to
background level difference that is much smaller ( ~2.5 dB for HLA verses
closer to 5 dB for the VLA ) compared to the VLA results.
   The second ambiguity plot show the array azimuth verses array bow. This 
plot shows the results to be well determined except that SAGA does not have
enough information to clearly differentiate between the true array shape and
the negative symetry solution.
