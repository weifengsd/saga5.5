Here are three simple programs to generate array shapes with tilt and bow 
( vertical array ) or bearing and bow ( horizontal array ). 

estimateBow   - will generate a vertical array shape given 5 parameters.
                the parameters are number of elements, Z coordinate of first 
                element, interelement spacing, tilt from element 1 in degrees, 
                and maximum amount of bow at array center. Output is in the
                format expected by field.

estimateHBow  - will generate a horizontal array shape given 5 parameters
                the parameters are number of elements, Y coordinate of first 
                element, interelement spacing, tilt from element 1 in degrees, 
                and maximum amount of bow at array center. Output is in the
                format expected by mplfield.

estimateHBowf - will take an input straight line array shape(file) and modify 
                it to have a particular bearing and bow.  Will also add a depth
                coordinate to the output. Unlike the first two routines, this
                does not have to have equally spaced elements. Output is in the
                format expected by mplfield.

maxCH.scr - script to use siops to compute maximum value in each channel of
            and sio data file.
maxminCH.scr - script to use siops to compute maximum and minimum values in 
            each channel of and sio data file.
