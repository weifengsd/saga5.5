This subdirectory generates the CSDMs for each of the 13 frequencies
used to perform MFP (Matched Field Processing).  The simulated data 
is created from the replica vector corresponding to a source at a 
range of 3 km and a depth of 60 m.  This is representative of experimental 
data from SWellEx-96 Event S5 starting at JD 131, 23:55 GMT.

The CSDM's are generated by running KRAKEN followed by FIELD to calculate 
the acoustic pressure received on an array for a source located at a range
of 3 km and depth of 60 m.  The simulated data CSDMs are created by taking 
the outer product of this data vector.  In MFP, since the data vector 
(in practice, the measured acoustic field) is cross-correlated with replica
vectors (the hypothesized acoustic fields), in this simulation there should
be a correlation of 1 (0 dB) at the source location of 3 km range and 60 m depth.
These CSDM's are then imported into SAGA where GA search is done as well as 
MFP.  There is a slight mismatch between SAGA and Kraken so the resulting
peak is not at 0 dB, but at -1.36 dB.  

To generate the CSDMs to import into SAGA, run the script "runAll.Rep.scr".
This calls runRep.scr for each frequency.  the script "runRep.scr" will 
run KRAKEN and FIELD and then use KRAKP to extract out the replica vector.
The CSDM is the outer product of this vector.

scripts:
runAll.Rep.scr - Main script to run example for the 13 frequencies of interest
runRep.scr    - for each specified frequency, compute the replica vectors
		via KRAKEN and FIELD, then generate the CSDMs for import into
                SAGA.
