This example simulates MFP (Match Field Processing) on multiple
frequencies.  This simulation models data with a source at
a range of 3 km and a depth of 60 meters.  This models data from
SwellEx 96 Event S5 starting at J131 23:55.

The simulated data is generated by running kraken and extracting
a replica vector with the source at a range of 3 km and depth of 60m
Then using this replica vector to generate a csdm. The csdm is then
cross-correlated with the replica vectors and should match perfectly
with the replica vector that has the source at a range of 3 km and 
depth of 60m.

To run the example, run the script "runAll.Rep.scr".

scripts:
runAll.Rep.scr - Main script to run example for the 13 frequencies of interest
runRep.scr    - for each specified frequency, compute the replica vector
                cross correlate the data and produce the ambiguity surface

subdirectory:
plots    -  plots of the ambiguity surface generated at each individual
            frequency are archived here
working  -  the data containing the ambiguity surfaces are archived here.
